    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to to teach our children the imporatance of reducing, resuing
      and recylcling in order to work towards the preservation of our planet.
      We're not really a free love, granola eating group, but rather a small
      family trying to leave our mark on the world, while not really leavng a
      mark. Check out our latest and greatest adventures.
